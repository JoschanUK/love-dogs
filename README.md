# Introduction
In love with Dogs is a website for like-minded people who just simply love dogs. In love with Dogs website is also created to remember my baby dog- Walker Chan who brought unconditional love to me for 19 years before he went to doggy heaven in 2019.

This website provides neccessary information based on experiences for first time dog owners on how to care and train their fur babies. Most importantly, I would want to form a group of dog lovers going on walks together to build friendship and to enable our fur babies to interact with each other.

    <p>Introduction</p>
    <p>
        In love with Dogs is a website for like-minded people who just simply love dogs. 
        In love with Dogs website is also created to remember my baby dog- Walker Chan who 
        brought unconditional love to me for 19 years before he went to doggy heaven in 2019.

        This website provides neccessary information based on experiences for first time dog 
        owners on how to care and train their fur babies. Most importantly, I would want to 
        form a group of dog lovers going on walks together to build friendship and to enable 
        our fur babies to interact with each other.
